    Plan

Step 1:
    > Time series
    - regroup datapoints into a time series
    - test with P/ACF (and seasonal_recompose)
    >> a time series

Step 2:
    > Factor selection
    - manual selection by visualization 
      <- (CIs / hypothesis testing?)
    (- selection by correlation?)
    - k-factorial selection
    >> a set of factors + interactions

Step 3:
    > Model
    - training several SARIMAX
    >> one model with the lowest AIC
